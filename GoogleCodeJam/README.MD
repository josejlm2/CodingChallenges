Google Code Jam
================
For the 12th year running, Google Code Jam returns as one of the top, 
programming competitions in the world. The contest, which consists of 
intense algorithmic puzzles held over multiple online rounds culminating 
in an on-site final round with the top 26 contestants, was bigger than ever last year with nearly 50,000 registrants and our first-ever live streamed finals.
